## NEWS

The two best papers of OrdRing2014 have the opportunity to be published on [Journal on Data Semantics](http://www.springer.com/computer/database+management+%26+information+retrieval/journal/13740).

## ABSTRACT

More and more applications require real-time processing of massive, dynamically generated, ordered data; where order is often an essential factor reflecting recency, proximity or relevance. Stream and rank-aware data management techniques are progressively providing reactive and reliable query answering over such massive datasets. Key to their success is the use of [streaming algorithms](#objectives "If N is the size of the input, a problem is considered to be “well- solved” by a streaming algorithm if such an algorithm requires at most O(poly(log(N)) space and time") that harness the natural or enforceable orders in the data. Semantic technologies can play a relevant role in this setting, exploiting their expressive power to integrate those highly dynamic sources. In the recent years, different work started to push order-related concepts in semantic technologies, such as Stream Reasoning and top-k ontological query answering. This workshop (as its predecessors in [2011](http://ordring2011.search-computing.org/), and [2013](events/ordring2013)) aims at bringing together this growing and very active community interested in **[integrating ordering with reasoning](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj246_1.pdf "Emanuele Della Valle, Stefan Schlobach, Markus Krötzsch, Alessandro Bozzon, Stefano Ceri, Ian Horrocks: Order matters! Harnessing a world of orderings for reasoning over massive data. Semantic Web 4(2): 219-231 (2013)")** by using methods inspired by stream and rank-aware data management.

## MOTIVATION

The continuous growth of volume, velocity and variety of data poses new challenge for their processing, especially when it has to be done in real-time or near-real time. It often happens that orders are involved in those processes: the input data can be ordered by some criteria (e.g. recency, proximity), and so the output data (e.g. relevance). In both cases, orders can play a key-role, enabling the design of ad-hoc algorithms and processes that exploit those orders to increase the performance. A relevant example can be found in rank-aware data management, where there are techniques to perform query answering through streaming algorithms that exploit the natural or enforceable orders in the data. Moreover, in stream data management, algorithms are not only designed to be online and streaming, but also any-time: they processes the input data and they produce sequences of valid answers at different time instants. The expressive power of Semantic technologies is needed in those applications, but Semantic Technologies risk being unable to address the needs of those applications, because they do not consider ordering as an essential property. Ranking results is often seen as an “added task”, performed after inference, without affecting the inference process, which is order-agnostic. However, we perceive a trend towards order-aware semantic technologies: both researchers and practitioners understand that _order matters in reasoning over massive and highly dynamic data_. The idea of Stream Reasoning is gaining considerable momentum. Some top-k query answering techniques for Linked Data appeared. Several works are considering SPARQL query answering on RDF annotated with labels partially ordered. The Description Logic community is investigating top-k ontological query answering. We see this workshop as a further step to stimulate and guide a paradigm shift in semantic technologies. We aim at involving researchers and experts in stream and rank-aware data management to put together their competences and to share them with the community. The final goal of the workshop is to contribute to this young, but very active trend of order-aware data processing.

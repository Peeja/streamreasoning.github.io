## ABSTRACT

More and more applications require real-time processing of massive, dynamically generated, ordered data, where order is often an essential factor reflecting recency. Data stream management techniques provide reactive and reliable processing mechanisms over such data. Key to their success is the use of streaming algorithms that harness the natural or enforceable orders in the data.

This trend started to be visible also in the Web, where an increasing number of streaming sources and datasets are becoming available. They originate from social networks, sensor networks, Internet of Things (IoT) and many other technologies that find in the Web a platform for sharing data. This is resulting in new Web-centric efforts such as the Web of Things, which studies how to expose and describe IoT using the Web, or the Social Web, which investigates protocols, vocabularies, and APIs to facilitate access to social functionality as part of the Web. In the Semantic Web context emerged efforts like Stream Reasoning and RDF Stream Processing. Stream Reasoning aims at combing data stream management and semantic technologies to perform reasoning over massive, heterogeneous and dynamic data;, while RDF Stream Processing studies the continuous query answering process over data streams modelled accordingly to the RDF model.

The workshop aims at putting together such sub-communities and to discuss and investigate holistic processing models for streams over the Web, which consider the issues about publishing data streams on the Web as well as processing them with queries and inference processes. The event will contribute in the creation of an active community interested in integrating stream processing and reasoning by using methods inspired by data and knowledge management.

## TOPICS OF INTEREST

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Modelling and Knowledge Representation for data streams
- Publishing and consuming data streams on the Web
- Data compression algorithms for data stream exchange over the Web
- Continuous query answering over data streams in the Web
- Complex Event Processing for Web data streams
- Ontological query answering over data streams in the Web
- Role of parallelization and distribution in Web stream processing
- Topologies for distributed processing of Web data streams
- Approximation approaches to processing Web Data streams
- Handling incomplete and noisy Web data streams
- Implementation and evaluation experiences
- Applications of stream reasoning
- Proposals for and applications of benchmarks

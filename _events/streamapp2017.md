## Abstract

The goal of the tutorial _How to build a stream reasoning application_ is threefold: to (1) present interesting research problems for Semantic Web that arise in querying and reasoning on a variety of highly dynamic data, (2) introduce stream reasoning techniques to Semantic Web researchers as powerful tools to use when addressing a data-centric problem characterised both by variety and velocity, and (3) to guide the participants through the construction of a stream reasoning application.

## Motivation

Nowadays, more and more dynamic information is becoming available to decision makers in the form of continuous data streams. These data streams are produced by a variety of sources including social networks, mobile phones, smart homes, healthcare devices and other modern infrastructures.They open unprecedented opportunities for a variety of modern applications to be developed in different domains including smart cities, smart homes, health monitoring. A common problem in these scenarios, is how to integrate such data and how to enable the creation of new knowledge. Reasoning techniques are a possible solution. However, while reasoners scale up in the classical, static domain of ontological knowledge, reasoning upon rapidly changing information has received attention only very recently. The combination of reasoning techniques with data streams gives rise to Stream Reasoning. This is a high impact research area that has already started to produce results relevant to both the semantic and data processing communities.

This tutorial aims at introducing different existing approaches for querying and reasoning over data streams in a Semantic Web context. In particular, the tutorial provides the audience (1) an overview of use cases and scenarios where Stream Reasoning can be used (with the advantages it brings); (2) an overview of the current state of the art in this emerging area, with techniques and tools developed by several research groups (including but not limited to presenters’ ones); (3) a focus on a subset of techniques to perform approximate inference and complex reasoning over dynamic data. The contents of this tutorial can be relevant for ISWC attendees as it focuses on reasoning (one of the key tasks for knowledge creation) in semantic data processing, addressing in particular streaming data as a new emerging scenario for a vast number of applications on the Web.

## Audience

The event targets researchers and practitioners interested in approaching the topic of semantic stream processing (both querying and reasoning) and that want to understand the current state of the art as well as the future directions. For this reason, the expected background knowledge is on basic concepts of RDF and SPARQL. The technologies and topics on this tutorial are relevant for people from IoT and sensor communities, as well as social media, pervasive health, oil industry, etc., who produce massive amounts of streaming data.

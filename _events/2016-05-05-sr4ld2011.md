# Tutorial on Stream Reasoning for Linked Data at ESWC 2011

![](images/eswc_logo.png)

## Abstract

The goal of the Stream Reasoning for Linked Data tutorial is twofold:

1. to introduce scalable reasoning and querying techniques to SW researchers as powerful tool to make use of linked data and large-scale ontologies, and
2. to present interesting research problems for SW that arise in reasoning with highly dynamic data streams \[1,7\].

The tutorial consists of five parts. It will begin with an introduction of linked data, as well as the Semantic Web standard ontology language OWL 2 and its related reasoning services. The introduction will include examples of how to make use of OWL 2 ontologies in linked data and how to use reasoning services to exploit linked data. It will then start with semantic processing of data streams explained using C-SPARQL, a continuous extension of SPARQL for querying RDF streams and RDF graphs. The third part of the tutorial will present stream reasoning techniques for RDFS and OWL2-RL. The fourth part will introduce approximate stream reasoning techniques for OWL2-DL. The last part of the tutorial is a hands-on session on some tools and systems related to the first four parts.

# Description

### Who is the target audience?

The target audience of the proposed tutorial includes researchers as well as practitioners who are interested in the latest technological developments on applying ontological stream reasoning services in linked data.

## What will the audience walk away with?

The material to be handed out to the attendees will be the tutorial slide set; we will also set up a separate web page that will contain all relevant information, additional material for download. Where possible, we will prepare online-interfaces for the presented tools that the users play around with

## What makes the topic innovative?

The tutorial focus on innovative stream reasoning techniques while presenting state-of-the-arts scalable reasoning and querying for the new W3C standard ontology language OWL 2.

### How long does it last?

The tutorial lasts for six hours (a full day tutorial).

### What should I know?

Although no specific pre-knowledge is required to follow the tutorial, basic knowledge in Semantic Web may allow better following the tutorial --- and for gaining more benefits from it.

## 14.00-15.00 -- Stream Reasoning techniques for RDFS and OWL2-RL (60m)

[This third session](/slides/2011/05/SR4LD-s3-Stream-Reasoning.pdf) presents our recent work on stream reasoning techniques for RDFS and OWL2-RL. This session covers:

- \[3.1\] Incrementally maintaining materializations of ontologies stored in logic database
- \[3.2\] Optimization techniques for incrementally maintaining materializations when changes are caused by streaming data \[4\]
- \[3.3\] Practical examples of continuous social media analysis \[3\]

### 15.00 -16.30 -- Approximate Reasoning and Approximate Stream Reasoning for OWL2-DL (60m including coffee break)

[This fourth session](/slides/2011/05/SR4LD-s4v3.pdf) present our recent work on faithful approximate reasoning for OWL2-DL, as well as its extensions for ontological stream reasoning in OLW2-DL. This session covers:

- \[4.1\] Approximate reasoning for OWL2-DL \[5,6\]
- \[4.2\] Approximate stream reasoning for OWL2-DL \[7\]

## 16.30 - 17.00 -- Hands-on Session (60m)

Each of the previous sessions was accompanied with small practical examples. As a final part of the tutorial, the attendees will practice and combine their experiences from the different sessions with a larger test case. The session will be conducted dividing the audience in small groups which will be guided by one of the presenters through an integrated test scenario.

**Jeff Z. Pan** received his Ph.D. from University of Manchester in 2004 and joined the faculty in the Department of Computing Science at University of Aberdeen in 2005. His research focuses primarily on knowledge representation and reasoning, in particular scalable ontology reasoning and querying, and their applications (such as Semantic Web, Software Engineering and Multimedia). His research led to over 90 refereed publications. He is an Associate Editor of the Journal of Advances in Artificial Intelligence and on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Web Semantics (JoWS), the International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems (IJSWIS) and the Journal of Emerging Technologies in Web Intelligence (JETWI). He served/serves as Program Chair of the First International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule System (RR2007, which is the first Semantic Web conference on Reasoning), of the Ontology and Reasoning Track in the Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC2010) and of the Doctoral Consortiums in the 9th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC2010) and in the 8th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC2011). He has given a number of invited talks, including a conference keynote, on ontology reasoning in general and scalable ontology query answering in particular.

Welcome to a new edition of the **_Stream Reasoning Hackathon_**. In this opportunity, we present two challenges with different scenarios: one related to urban mobility and the other related to reasoning in the driving context. This event is the initial part of the [Stream Reasoning Workshop](http://streamreasoning.org/events/srw2021), and its schedule is as follows:

**Monday, 4th of October 2021**

**09:00 - 09:45** Introduction and introducing  
**09:45 - 10:15** Discussion of scenarios and tasks  
**10:15 - 10:35** Coffee break  
**10:35 - 13:00** Hackathon part 1  
**13:00 - 14:30** Lunch (external)  
**14:30 - 16:00** Hackathon part 2  
**16:15 - 16:35** Coffee break  
**16:35 - 18:00** Hackathon part 3  
**18:00 - 18:30** Presentations and conclusion

## Overview

Stream reasoning is an emerging area that focuses on inference (by deduction or induction) over data streams. It has been actively evolving for more than a decade now. Since the type of tasks for stream reasoning can be considerably diverse, it has become desirable to have a well-defined set of general tasks accompanied by the corresponding data sets and tooling to “compare” the different approaches. So that different stakeholders (e.g., reasoner developer) can use them as a starting point to showcase and validate their tools. Hence, this hackathon is an initiative to provide such resources to the community.

The hackathon is designed as a _“model and solve”_ challenge, where participants have the freedom to solve the presented tasks with the approaches and techniques, which are most familiar to them. The principal points are the following:

- Two well-defined Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) scenarios, where participants can show their skills and tools. The scenarios consist of (A) a simulation-generated traffic flow scenario with a few intersections and several vehicles, and (B) a driving trace from the perspective of an ego vehicle moving in a city.
- A simple platform for stream generation and a background model (KB) thatis given beforehand to the participants.
- Different “model and solve” tasks are provided for each scenario, where tasks are increasing in difficulty. Until the start of the hackathon, only introductorytasks are given. At the official start, we will provide the more challenging tasks to the teams.

## Prices

We are happy to announce that [Siemens AG, Austria](https://new.siemens.com/at) and the [Zentrum für Informatikforschung](http://zif.or.at/) are each sponsoring one Amazon gift card of 100 Euro. The prices will be awarded to the teams that scores highest in development effort, understandability, problem coverage, and originality of their solutions.

Teams that participated in the SR Hackathon 2021 edition

## Winners

The winners were elected by votes coming from the teams and from the organizers. The aspects considered were: development effort, clarity and easiness of use, problem coverage, and originality of the solution. Each team had only one vote. Teams were not allowed to vote for themselves. Thus, there were 5 possible votes from the teams. Those were complemented with 3 votes from the organizers. The winners of this edition were:

- Oxford University (3 votes)
- University of Calabria (3 votes)

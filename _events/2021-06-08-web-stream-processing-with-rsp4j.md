### Abstract

This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to Webstream processing, including some fundamental aspects of stream reasoning. Moreover, the tutorial covers all the stages of the Web Stream Processing applications lifecycle. Central to the tutorial is the recently published RDF4J library, which uniforms the interaction with existing RDF Stream Processing engines.

In practice, the tutorial will include a survey on existing research outcomes from the Stream Reasoning / RDF Stream Processing area, i.e.,  
continuous querying, reactive reasoning over highly dynamic graph data;  
(i) the introduction of the Streaming Linked Data lifecycle, for modelling, publishing, serving, and processing streaming data  
(ii) the positioning of existing Webstream processing ending, via RSP4J, to build and maintain Web Stream Processing applications.  
  
The tutorial will include several examples build around a relevant use case. Moreover, we plan to release the material together with a number of exercises for the attendees.

## Organizers

#### Riccardo Tommasini

Riccardo Tommasini is an assistant professor at the University of Tartu, Estonia. Riccardo did his PhD at the Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering of Politecnico di Milano. His thesis, titled "Velocity on the Web", investigates the velocity aspects that concern the variety of information that populates the Web environment. His research interests span Stream Processing, Knowledge Graphs, Logics, and Programming Languages. Riccardo's tutorial activities comprise Stream Reasoning Tutorials at ISWC 2017, ICWE 2018, ESWC 2019, and TheWebConf 2019, and DEBS 2019.

#### Pieter Bonte

Pieter Bonte is a Post-doctoral researcher at the University of Ghent, IMEC, IDLab. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Ghent. His research focuses on the use of Semantic Web technologies in the IoT, with a speci?c focus on scalable \\& distributed reasoning, stream reasoning, and RDF Stream Processing. He is particularly interested in increasing the expressivity of reasoning over high volatile streams. He has been active in several interdisciplinary projects, in which he was able to leverage his research in an industrial setting. Furthermore, he detailed his research at more than ten international conferences.

## OBJECTIVES

More and more applications require real-time processing of massive, dynamically generated, ordered data; where order is often an essential factor reflecting recency, proximity or relevance. Stream and rank-aware data management techniques are progressively providing reactive and reliable query answering over such massive datasets, allowing integration of highly dynamic sources. Key to their success is the use of [streaming algorithms](#objectives "If N is the size of the input, a problem is considered to be “well- solved” by a streaming algorithm if such an algorithm requires at most O(poly(log(N)) space and time") that harness the natural or enforceable orders in the data. The expressive power of Semantic technologies is needed in those applications, but Semantic Technologies risk being unable to address the needs of those applications, because they do not consider ordering as an essential property. Ranking results is often seen as an “added task”, performed after inference, without affecting the inference process, which is order-agnostic.

However, we perceive a trend towards [order-aware semantic technologies](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj246_1.pdf): both researchers and practitioners understand that order matters in reasoning over massive and highly dynamic data. The idea of Stream Reasoning is gaining considerable momentum. Some top-k query answering techniques for Linked Data appeared. Several works are considering SPARQL query answering on RDF annotated with labels partially ordered. The Description Logic community is investigating top-k ontological query answering.

This workshop aims at bringing together this growing and very active community interested in integrating ordering with reasoning by using methods inspired by stream and rank-aware data management. We see this workshop as a first step to stimulate and guide a paradigm shift in semantic technologies.

## TOPICS OF INTEREST

Topics include, but not limited to:

- Inferencing with streaming algorithms
- Ontological query answering over highly dynamic data
- Incremental maintenance of materialization of highly dynamic data
- Ontological top-k query answering over massive ordered data
- A top-k query answering for fuzzy logics
- Continuous query answering for fuzzy logics
- Knowledge Representation for ordered facts
- Applications of stream reasoning and top-k ontological query answering
- Role of parallelization and distribution in order-aware semantic technologies
- Harvesting and combining orders in data
- Approximation approaches to inference with orderings
- Proposals for and applications of benchmarks
- Implementation and evaluation experiences

## SUBMISSIONS

We will welcome submissions describing ideas, experiments, and application visions originating from requirements for, and efforts aimed at, interleaving ordering and reasoning. We will encourage **demos and posters** not exceeding 4 pages, short **position papers** not exceeding 6 pages as well as longer **technical papers** not exceeding 12 pages. They should follow the LNCS proceedings style files.

Submissions should be formatted according to the Lecture Notes in Computer Science guidelines for proceedings available at [http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0). Papers should be submitted in PDF format. All submissions will be done electronically via the OrdRing2013 web submission system ([http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ordring2013](http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ordring2013)).  
  
At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop. Information about registration will appear soon on the [ISWC 2013 Web page](http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/).

## Abstract

The goal of the Stream Reasoning for Linked Data tutorial is twofold: to (1) introduce scalable reasoning and querying techniques to SW researchers as powerful tool to make use of linked data and large-scale ontologies, and to (2) present interesting research problems for SW that arise in reasoning with highly dynamic data streams \[DCvF09,RPZ10a\]. The tutorial consists of five parts. It will begin with an introduction of linked data streams, as well as reasoning using the Semantic Web standard ontology language OWL 2. The second part will introduce semantic processing of data streams explained using C-SPARQL, a continuous extension of SPARQL for querying RDF streams and RDF graphs. The third part will provide an overview of ontology-based access to data streams through query rewriting to Stream Processing Engines and using stream-to-ontology mappings. The fourth part of the tutorial is a hands-on session on tools and systems related to the previous parts. The fith part of the tutorial will present other stream reasoning techniques for RDFS and OWL2-RL. The last part will wrap up the tutorial and present an overview of the open challenges.

## Motivation

Nowadays, more and more dynamic information is becoming available to decision makers in the form of continuous data streams. These data streams occur in a variety of modern applications, such as network monitoring, traffic engineering, sensor networks, RFID tags, microposts, telecom records, Web logs, click-streams, etc. Processing these continuous flows of information and reasoning taking into account ontological knowledge is certainly one of the key challenges for semantics in the future Internet. While reasoners scale up in the classical, static domain of ontological knowledge, reasoning upon rapidly changing information has received attention only very recently. The combination of reasoning techniques with data streams gives rise to Stream Reasoning, a high impact research area that has already started to produce results that are relevant for both the semantic and data processing communities. This tutorial aims at introducing different existing approaches for reasoning and querying over data streams, and providing the audience with an overview of techniques and tools that can be used for this purpose. The contents of this tutorial can be relevant for ISWC attendees as it focuses in two of the main tasks in semantic data processing, reasoning and querying, in the context of streaming data that is ubiquitous in a large number of applications on the Web.

## Program

This session presents IMaRS, a variation of DRed for the incremental maintenance of the window materializations. This session covers:

- Optimization techniques for incrementally maintaining materializations when changes are caused by streaming data
- Practical examples of continuous social media analysis

### Fourth part: The Stream Reasoning Realm

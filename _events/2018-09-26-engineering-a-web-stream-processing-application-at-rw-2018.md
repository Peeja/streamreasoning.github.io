### Introduction

The goal of the tutorial is to outline how to develop and deploy a stream processing application in a Web environment in a repro ducible way.

To this extent, we intend to

1. survey existing research outcomes from the Stream Reasoning /RDF Stream Processing that arise in querying and reasoning on a variety of highly dynamic data,
2. introduce stream reasoning techniques as powerful tools to use when addressing a data-centric problem characterized both by variety and velocity (such as those typically found on the modern Web),
3. present a relevant Web-centric use-case that requires to address simultaneously data velocity and variety, and
4. guide the participants through the development of a Web stream processing application

### Lecturer

**![](images/emanuele.jpg)Emanuele Della Valle** is an Assistant Professor of Software Project Management at the Department of Electronics and Information of the Politecnico di Milano. He tries to perform research that is justified and guided by business needs. His major interest is in translating research results into business opportunities. In more than a decade of research, his research interests covered Semantic Web, Web Services, Service Oriented Architectures, Search Engines and, more recently on Stream Management Systems and Rank-aware Databases. His education activities include lecturing: Software Project Management at Politecnico di Milano; Knowledge Engineering at Universita dell Insubria; the RDF stream Processing tutorial at ESWC 2014, the Stream Reasoning for Linked Data tutorial series at SemTech 2011, ESWC 2011, ISWC 2013, ISWC 2014, ISWC 2015 the LarKC Early Adopters Tutorial Series at ISWC 2009, and ESWC 2010; a tutorial about Realizing Semantic Web Applications at BIS 2008, ISWC 2008, and ICWE 2010; and several industrial short courses for CEFRIEL centered on future evolution of the Web. In 2008 he was an author of the first Italian Semantic Web book. Between 2004 and 2007, he was lecturer of Advanced Information Systems at Politecnico di Milano.

### Those that did most of the hard work

**Riccardo Tommasini** is a Ph.D. student at the Department of Electronics and Information of the Politecnico di Milano. He enrolled in November 2015, focusing on how to realize an efficient yet Expressive stream reasoning approach. His research interest comprises Reasoning and Ontology-Based Data Access, Stream Processing and Complex Event Processing, Temporal Logics and Benchmarking. Riccardo’s teaching activities comprise (i) a Big Data Tutorial with practical classes on Esper and C-SPARQL during his visiting at Kno.e.sis Center at Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio. (ii) He is a teaching assistant at Politecnico di Milano for the courses: Interoperability and Semantic Web Technologies (15-16) and Principles of Programming Languages (16-217, 17-18).

**![](images/marco.jpg)Marco Balduini** is a Ph.D. student at the Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria (DEIB) of the Politecnico di Milano. His research work focuses on data integration, data processing, and semantic web. His major interest is the management of heterogeneous stream of spatio-temporal data. He developed Natron, a general-purpose system for stream processing. He is actively involved in the development of the C-SPARQL Engine and in the W3C Community Group on RDF Stream Processing (RSP). He participated in the research activities of the EU FP7 projects LarKC and ModaClouds and in the EIT projects City Data Fusion for Event Management, Crowd Insights, and Welcome. He is also a co-founder of Fluxedo, a start-up that exploits cutting-edge technology in the field of big data management and analysis.

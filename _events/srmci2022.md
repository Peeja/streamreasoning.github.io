## Aims and Scope

  After the successful <a href="https://streamreasoning.org/events/">Stream Reasoning</a> workshops in the previous years,
  we invite you to a spinoff of the main workshop with a focus on
  bringing practitioner and researcher from industry and academia together.
  The workshop is **invitation-only**, **free-of-charge**, and will be held at Siemens
  Technology in Munich, Germany.

  Stream data has become ubiquitous, and the processing, querying, and reasoning over
  streaming data is being studied in different communities such as KRR, Semantic Web,
  Databases, Stream Processing, Complex Event Processing, and Machine Learning.

  This event will bring together people working on practical projects, applications and
  tools for stream reasoning and cloud-edge intelligence, spread around different domains,
  from autonomous driving to smart building, data spaces, and industry 4.0. The event will host a series
  of keynotes around the different topics, as well as plenty of time for
  discussions and networking.

## Venue

The workshop will be held **on-site** at Siemens Technology, Otto-Hahn-Ring 6, 81739 München
(see on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/tKD6XT6gwYUeYUAv6">Google Maps</a>).
Easiest to reach is by train line S7 and metro line U5 with destination
<a href="https://www.mvv-muenchen.de/plaene-bahnhoefe/bahnhofsinformation/station/neuperlach-sued/index.html">Neuperlach Süd</a>.
After arriving, take the southern exit and turn directly left, which brings you to a side-entrance of the campus.


## Accomodation and Travel


We recommend to stay in the one of the two hotels that are close to the venue:


- <a href="https://all.accor.com/hotel/0792/index.en.shtml">Mercure Hotel Munich Neuperlach South</a>
- <a href="https://www.leonardo-hotels.com/munich/leonardo-hotel-munich-city-east">Leonardo Hotel Munich City East</a>


For more affordable options, we advise to check on the big travel platforms like Booking, Expedia, or HRS.
If you choose a hotel along the route of the train line S7, the trip from the centre, e.g, Marienplatz,
requires only 17min.
